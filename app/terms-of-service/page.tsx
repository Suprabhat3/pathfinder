              Path Menties provides an AI-powered service designed to generate
              personalized learning roadmaps based on user goals, skills, and
              time constraints. Our learning content suggestions are generated
              computationally and provided "as is". We aim for high accuracy but
              cannot guarantee that all generated paths perfectly reflect
              real-world learning nuances or current industry standards.

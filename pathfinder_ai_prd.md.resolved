# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name: **PathFinder AI** (Working Title)
### Tagline: *Your AI-Powered Journey to Success.*

---

## 1. Executive Summary
**PathFinder AI** is an intelligent web application designed to help students, self-learners, and professionals generate structured, goal-oriented roadmaps. By leveraging AI, the platform provides step-by-step, actionable plans tailored to a user's specific goals, timeline, and current skill level. 

The application will adopt the premium, ATS-friendly aesthetic of **ATScV** (built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide icons), utilizing a clean `slate-50` background, `emerald` accents, and modern typography (Geist/Geist Mono).

## 2. Target Audience
*   **High School & College Students:** Planning their academic journey or preparing for competitive exams.
*   **Self-Taught Developers/Designers:** Transitioning into tech without formal education.
*   **Professionals:** Seeking upskilling or career pivots.

---

## 3. Core Problems & Solutions
| Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| Users don't know where to start when learning a complex topic. | AI generates a chronological, step-by-step roadmap from absolute zero to mastery. |
| Generic roadmaps are overwhelming and not tailored to the user's timeline. | The user inputs their timeline (e.g., "3 months", "1 year") and the AI adjusts the pacing and milestones. |
| Difficult to track progress across scattered resources. | Built-in progress tracking (checkboxes, completion percentages) directly within the generated roadmap. |

## 4. Features & Requirements

### 4.1. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features
1.  **AI Roadmap Generator:**
    *   **Input Form:** Ask users for:
        *   Their Goal (e.g., "Become a Full-Stack Developer", "Learn Machine Learning").
        *   Their Current Level (Beginner, Intermediate).
        *   Their Time Commitment (e.g., "10 hours/week for 6 months").
    *   **AI Engine Integration:** Use an LLM (OpenAI/Anthropic) to generate a JSON-structured roadmap based on the prompt.
2.  **Interactive Roadmap Visualization:**
    *   Display the AI response in a clean, vertical timeline or step-by-step card layout.
    *   Each step should include:
        *   Topic Title.
        *   Brief Description.
        *   Estimated Time.
        *   Recommended Resources (links to free documentation, YouTube, etc., generated by AI).
3.  **Progress Tracking (Local Storage initially):**
    *   Ability to mark individual steps/modules as "Completed".
    *   Visual progress bar indicating overall percentage.
4.  **Save & Export:**
    *   Save roadmaps locally or export them as PDF/Markdown.

### 4.2. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
*   **User Authentication:** Save roadmaps to a user account (Supabase/Firebase/Clerk).
*   **Community Roadmaps:** Share successful roadmaps publicly and allow users to upvote them.
*   **Resource Validation:** Ensure the AI-recommended links are actually valid and high quality.
*   **Calendar Integration:** Export the steps as deadlines to Google Calendar or Apple Calendar.

## 5. Design & User Experience (UX) Pattern
*   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router), React.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
*   **Aesthetic:** Inherit the ATScV design language:
    *   **Background:** `bg-slate-50` for the main body.
    *   **Text:** `text-slate-900` for headings, `text-slate-600` for paragraphs.
    *   **Accents:** `emerald-500` / `emerald-600` for primary buttons, highlights, and active states.
    *   **Components:** Glassmorphism/white cards with subtle borders (`border-slate-200`) and slight box-shadows.
    *   **Typography:** Geist and Geist Mono.
    *   **Icons:** Lucide React.

---

## 6. Architecture & Tech Stack
*   **Frontend:** Next.js 15+, React 19, Tailwind CSS.
*   **Backend/API:** Next.js Route Handlers.
*   **AI Provider:** OpenAI API (GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini) or Anthropic Claude, utilizing structured JSON output formats to ensure the roadmap parses cleanly into UI components.
*   **State Management:** React Context or Zustand.

---

## 7. User Flow
1.  **Landing Page:** User lands on a beautiful, ambient background (`<BackgroundAmbience />`). They see the tagline: "Stop guessing. Start achieving. Let AI build your perfect learning roadmap."
2.  **Input Phase:** User clicks "Start for Free" and fills out a clean, multi-step form detailing their goals and timeline.
3.  **Generation Phase:** A loading skeleton appears while the AI constructs the roadmap.
4.  **Interaction Phase:** The roadmap is presented. The user interacts with it, checks off the first task, and bookmarks/downloads the link.

---

## 8. Development Phases

*   **Phase 1: UI/UX & Scaffolding (1-2 Days)**
    *   Setup Next.js project.
    *   Replicate the landing page aesthetics (similar to ATScV).
    *   Create static roadmap UI components (Timeline, Step Cards).
*   **Phase 2: AI Integration (2-3 Days)**
    *   Setup the backend API route.
    *   Craft the perfect system prompt for the LLM to output structured roadmap JSON.
    *   Connect the frontend form to the API and render the dynamic response.
*   **Phase 3: State & Polish (1-2 Days)**
    *   Implement "Check off" functionality.
    *   Add PDF export or LocalStorage saving.
    *   Finalize styling and edge cases.
